# Route Fix Summary

## Issue
The dashboard navigation was trying to access `/teams` which didn't exist, causing a 404 error.

## Root Cause
- Dashboard navigation buttons were using incorrect route paths
- Missing redirect routes for common navigation patterns
- No proper error handling for 404 errors

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Dashboard Navigation
- ✅ **Join Team Button**: Changed from `/teams` → `/team`
- ✅ **My Playmate Card**: Changed from `/my-playmate` → `/playmate/index`
- ✅ **Create Event Card**: Changed from `/create-event` → `/events`
- ✅ **Other buttons**: Already correctly configured

### 2. Added Redirect Routes
Added proper redirects for common navigation patterns:
- `/teams` → `/team` (permanent redirect)
- `/my-playmate` → `/playmate/index` (permanent redirect)
- `/create-event` → `/events` (permanent redirect)

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added custom 404 error page component
- Added `errorElement` to router configuration
- Better UX with "Go Back" and "Go to Dashboard" buttons
- Consistent styling with app theme

## Router Configuration

```typescript
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "",
    Component: Layout,
    errorElement: <ErrorPage />, // Custom error page
    children: [
      // Existing routes
      { path: "/team", Component: MyTeam },
      { path: "/playmate/index", Component: MyPlaymate },
      { path: "/events", Component: Events },
      
      // New redirect routes
      { path: "/teams", loader: () => redirect("/team") },
      { path: "/my-playmate", loader: () => redirect("/playmate/index") },
      { path: "/create-event", loader: () => redirect("/events") },
    ]
  }
]);
```

## Testing Results

✅ **All navigation buttons work correctly**
✅ **404 errors show friendly error page**
✅ **Redirects work seamlessly**
✅ **No more "Unexpected Application Error" messages**

## URLs Tested
- ✅ `http://localhost:3003/teams` → Redirects to `/team`
- ✅ `http://localhost:3003/my-playmate` → Redirects to `/playmate/index`
- ✅ `http://localhost:3003/create-event` → Redirects to `/events`
- ✅ `http://localhost:3003/nonexistent` → Shows custom 404 page

## Impact
- **Better UX**: Users get helpful error messages instead of crashes
- **Seamless Navigation**: All dashboard buttons work as expected
- **Error Recovery**: Users can easily navigate back or to dashboard
- **Maintainable**: Clear routing structure with proper redirects

The routing system is now robust and user-friendly!
